# shovelware
A game about playing minigames.

## Controls (for now)
* Player 1: WASD, F.
* Player 2: arrow keys, enter

## Installation
(Currently, no bundled executable binary is available, so you need [love2d 0.10](https://love2d.org/) installed to directly run `.love` files.)

See [here](https://github.com/PocketEngi/shovelware/releases) for official releases of the game.

To "build" the latest version from source, download the repository as a zip archive and rename it to `shovelware.love`, or clone the repository and put the contents into a zip archive called `shovelware.love`.
